ANSWERS

Question 1: components of DBMS
Hardware- he hardware provides the resources needed to run the DBMS and store the actual data.
software- The software layer enables all the database operations, including defining the schema, managing the data, running queries, and controlling access. 
Data- The data is at the heart of any DBMS. It is organized in various structures like tables, rows, columns, and relationships.
procedures- The data is at the heart of any DBMS. It is organized in various structures like tables, rows, columns, and relationships.
Database access language- The database access language allows users and applications to communicate with the DBMS and perform operations such as selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

Question 2: Relational database and examples
A relational database is a type of database that stores data in a structured format using rows and columns, which are organized into tables.
Examples include; MySQL,PostgreSQL,Oracle Database,Microsoft SQL Server

Question 3: Classifications of SQL
Data Query Language (DQL)
DQL is used to retrieve data from the database. The main operation in DQL is the SELECT statement, which allows users to query the database to fetch data according to specified criteria.
Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL is used to define and manage database structures, such as creating, altering, or deleting tables and other database objects.
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
DML is used to manipulate and interact with the data stored in the database. This includes inserting, updating, and deleting data. It does not affect the structure or schema of the database. 

Question 4: Difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key
A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot have NULL values while A Foreign Key links two tables by referencing the primary key in another table, allowing for relationships between data. 

Question 5: Entity-Relationship Diagram
An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram is a visual representation of the entities in a database and the relationships between them. It uses symbols like rectangles to represent entities, diamonds for relationships, and lines to show how entities are connected.

Question 6: Advantages of relational databases
Relational databases enforce rules like primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
They allow for complex queries and the ability to relate multiple tables, making it easy to manipulate and analyze data.
Relational databases can handle large volumes of data and are scalable as data grows.
They offer robust security features, including user access controls and data encryption.
Through normalization, relational databases reduce data redundancy and ensure efficient storage.
They provide support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transaction processing.

Question 7: Data type used to store data in tables 
INT
VARCHAR
DATE
DECIMAL

Question 8: Purpose of a database management system 
The purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS) is to manage and organize data efficiently. It provides an interface to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency.
